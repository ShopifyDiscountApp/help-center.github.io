In Optionify, **Option Sets** allow you to group product options together for easier management and assignment across multiple products.

## Assign Types

When assigning Option Sets to products, there are several assignment types:

1. **Manual Assignment**
   - Assign Option Sets to products one by one.
   - Use this type when you want precise control over each product.

2. **Automatic Assignment**
   - Automatically assign Option Sets based on product attributes.
   - Saves time when handling large catalogs.

3. **Conditional Assignment**
   - Set rules to assign Option Sets only if certain conditions are met.
   - Example: Assign a "Color Options" set only to products in the "T-Shirts" category.

## Tips

- Always review assigned Option Sets in your product list to avoid conflicts.
- Use **Automatic Assignment** for new products to maintain consistency.
- Combine **Conditional** and **Automatic** types for the most efficient workflow.
